# TeachingStatGene2020
Lecture notes from FAll 2020 for a 12-week course for 4th undergrad in statistics and/or graduate students in stat/biostat.

I typically teach the content in the module 1-15 sequence, but this year (Fall 2021)  
- I decided to teach association before linkage, i.e. module 1-3, 12, 11, 4, 5 etc. mainly to get the students excited earlier on.  
- I have also invited [Dr. Andrew Paterson](https://www.sickkids.ca/en/staff/p/andrew-paterson/) to give a lecture on Genetics Background as the content in module 2 is clearly sub-optimal, and Dr. Paterson's lecture note is shared here with his permission.
